Hussein aka Capotudo here. I would like to give a little background about me, Statistics and Programming have been chasing me long time. Maybe this is how life works, I was trying to stay away from these topics during 20 years. I made little progress with Statisctics like 5 years ago, now it's time to understand programming and all its benefits. I am fascinated with the potential that can be achieved combining Programming and Statistics. I am at beginner level, but with deeply desire to complete my projects..
