Capotudo new repository
Jelou there,

Hussein aka as Capotudo here. I would like to give a litte bit of background about me, I was trying to stay away from Programming and Statistics since my university days (what a loser!). These 2 areas have been chasing me around since those days, maybe this is how life works. I made progress with Statistics like 3 years ago, this learning process forced me to appreciate the value of applied knowledge. I would like to complete simulations programs that can be applied in differents areas.
